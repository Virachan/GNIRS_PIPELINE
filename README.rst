A Python-driven PyRAF data reduction pipeline for the Gemini Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (GNIRS).

Full documentation: `ReadTheDocs <http://gnirs-pype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This is a new data reduction Python pipeline, currently under development, that uses 
Astroconda and the Gemini IRAF Package to reduce GNIRS data. It will offer a complete 
data reduction process from sorting the data to producing a final flux calibrated and 
wavelength calibrated combined spectrum with the full S/N for a science target.

This pipeline is open source and it is supported via the `Gemini Data Reduction User Forum <http://drforum.gemini.edu/>`_.

Any feedback and comments (astephens@gemini.edu) are welcome!
